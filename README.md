# Breadth first search and iterative deepening algorithms

## Breadth first search
Is implemented to solve the 'vacuum world' problem described in Artificial intelligence : a modern approach, Chapter 3 Section 3.4.1.

## Iterative deepening depth-first search algorithm
Is implemented to solve an AI Search for Autonomous Vehicle Navigation problem. The autonomous vehicle is supposed to navigate from point A to point B on the map, avoiding traffic jams.
